As a Business Analytics student with a passion for finding business solutions, I have a Bachelor's degree in Entrepreneurship and Innovation and over two years of experience working as a Strategic Planning Coordinator, during this time, I have developed effective strategies and implemented innovative methodologies such as OKRs and MVPs to increase operational efficiency by 20% and improve business outcomes in the healthcare industry.

Master of Business Analytics (MBAN)
Expected graduation year: 08/2024
Hult International Business School | San Francisco, United States

As a current student in the Master of Business Analytics program at Hult International Business School, I am gaining valuable expertise in data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning and communication strategies. I have developed my technical skills in Python, SQL, R and Tableau, allowing me to gather, analyze, and interpret data to drive business growth.

Regression Modeling Project.

Objective The bike sharing industry has grown tremendously in recent years, with an estimated global value of $2.8 billion in 2023. This is due to a number of factors, such as convenience, sustainability, and physical fitness. As a result of the market's growth, your client, a major city in the United States, has tasked you with developing a machine learning model to predict the number of bike rentals on a given day, as well as to provide insights into the factors that contribute to bike rental demand.

The Client The Cook County Planning and Development Department, responsible for the Chicago metropolitan area in the United States.

Modeling Steps

Package and Dataset Imports Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing EDA - descriptive statistics, histograms, correlation, etc. DP - missing value imputation, transformations, etc. Feature Engineering (at least three features have been engineered and their rationales have been explained) Candidate Model Development One model from each permitted modeling type has been developed (see Permitted Model Types). Choose your best model from each model type. Hyperparameter tuning has been performed on your top three models. Final Model Selection It is clear which model was selected as the final model and the rationale for choosing this model is sound.

Analysis

Analysis Introduction Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing . Each data visualization is explained with at least 5 sentences. Feature Engineering Candidate Model Development and Final Model Selection
